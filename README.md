This is a very simple module to provide a custom block with an archive of blog nodes (content type "article").

The reason for its creation is that, although views can provide a block with summaries by year and month, displaying nodes in a list grouped by year and month is actually quite a pain, and I am always being asked for this functionality by clients. So I thought it would be a good idea to create a quick rough-and-ready custom module for it.

The module provides a block, nothing more. There are some snippets of jQuery and CSS included to get you started on theming.
